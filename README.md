# 1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?

# -Machine learning models are trained and tested using the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of tiny grayscale photos of apparel items such as shirts, shoes, and bags. In essence, it is a contemporary substitute for the traditional handwritten digit MNIST dataset.

# 2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?

# -For the model to learn patterns more readily and precisely, we normalize image pixel values to speed up and stabilize training.

# 3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.

# -Input layer – receives the image data

# -Hidden layers (Dense/Convolutional layers) – extract and learn important features from the image

# -Output layer – gives the final prediction or class label

# 4. What does an epoch mean in model training?

# -One whole run of the training dataset through the model during training is referred to as an epoch.

# 5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.


# 6. What could be done to improve the model's accurancy?

# -By using more training data, adjusting hyperparameters, adding or enhancing layers, and training the model over more epochs, the accuracy of the model can be increased.
